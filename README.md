# VATNZ Standard Route Tool

The Standard Route Tool allows for our Controllers and Pilots to search through and copy any Standard Routes that are present in the New Zealand AIP. 
The Tool outputs them in an easy to read format, where the user then has the ability to copy them to their clipboard.

This Tool is available as a discrete plugin for vatSys, in addition to being available as a standalone application, allowing for the use of the tool with EuroScope in addition to general piloting use.
